For you I was a flame 
Love is a losing game 
Five story fire as you came 

Love is a losing game 
One I wish I never played 
Oh what a mess we made 
And now the final frame 

Love is a losing game 
Played out by the band 
Love is a losing hand 
More than I could stand
 
Love is a losing hand 
Self professed, profound 
'Til the chips were down 
Know you’re a gambling man 
Love is a losing hand
